# Thrive Architecture

Welcome to the **Thrive Architecture** documentation.

This repo provides a **high‑level, non‑technical overview** of how Thrive's digital tools work together to deliver sermon, podcast, and church information to people across:

- The **Thrive mobile app**
- The **Thrive public website** (`thrive-fl.org`)
- Internal **admin tools** used by the tech and communications teams

It's designed to answer questions like:

- What are the main pieces of the Thrive system?
- How do the app, website, and API fit together?
- Where do sermons and podcasts actually come from?

If you need **deep technical details** (code, endpoints, schemas, deployment scripts), see the individual code repositories. This site is intentionally **overview‑focused**.

## Big Picture

At a high level, the Thrive ecosystem has five main parts:

1. **Global API** - The central data and services layer for sermons, podcasts, and configuration.
2. **Mobile App** - The Thrive Church app used by attenders to listen to messages, take notes, and connect.
3. **Public Website** - The main marketing and information site for the church.
4. **Admin Tool** - A web tool used by staff to upload and manage sermon and podcast content.
5. **AI Processing Pipeline** - Behind‑the‑scenes services that generate summaries, tags, and podcast feeds.

All of these work together to provide:

- Fresh, high‑quality sermon and podcast content
- A consistent experience across app and website
- Simple tools for staff to keep everything up to date
