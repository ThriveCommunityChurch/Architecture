# Mobile App

The **Thrive mobile app** is the primary way many attenders interact with sermons and church information on their phones.

## Main Features

- **Listen**
  - Browse sermon series with artwork and titles
  - Open a message to see details: title, speaker, date, passage
  - Read a short, AI‑generated summary
  - See topical tags and tap them to find related content
  - Stream audio or download messages for offline listening

- **Notes**
  - Take personal notes while listening
  - Keep notes organized by message and searchable on the device

- **Connect & More**
  - Access contact info, directions, small groups, serving opportunities, prayer requests
  - Open "I'm New", "Give", and social media links
  - All driven by configuration from the **Global API**, so content can change without updating the app itself

## How It Connects

The app uses the **Global API** to:

- Load series and messages
- Fetch summaries, tags, artwork, and audio URLs
- Get configuration for menus and quick links

The podcast feed generated by the **AI Processing Pipeline** is consumed by external podcast apps, while the mobile app itself reads data directly from the Global API.

## Design Goals

- **Simple for attenders** - clear entry points ("Listen", "Notes", "Connect", "More").
- **Reliable offline** - downloads and local notes keep working even with spotty connectivity.
- **Config‑driven** - many parts of the app can be updated from the Admin Tool without shipping a new version.
